# Care4World
The project is basically a platform that allows users to donate small amounts anonymously to random charitable causes or individuals in need. It is completely built using Next.js and Typescript.
Features:
Anonymous donation system with random cause matching
Charities/individuals can register to receive micro-donations
Donation transparency: Users get a report showing where their money went
Future Developments:
Users can see stories of people or projects they helped fund
Gamification: Rewards for donating frequently or achieving milestones
API integration with popular payment platforms (e.g., PayPal, Stripe)

## How it Works ?
1. While running the project an 'Index page' opens where there is two options; either you can select 'Donate' or 'Register Cause'.
2. On selecting 'Donate' we can choose to donate certain amount to  chany charitable organization around the world at random.
3. 'Register Cause' will help organizations to register for cause for accepting donations.
